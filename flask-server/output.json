This involves calculating the number of bits needed for the host portion of the address and choosing a corresponding subnet mask (e.g., /24, /26, /27). \n4. **Assign Subnets:** Allocate the IP address ranges and subnet masks to the departments. Ensure there is sufficient space for future growth and consider using a consistent organizational structure to manage the IP addresses.\n5. **Document the scheme:** Create a clear and organized document outlining the IP addressing scheme. This document should include all IP ranges, subnet masks, network addresses, broadcast addresses, and assigned departments. \n6. **Test the scheme:** Thoroughly test the IP addressing scheme to ensure it functions correctly before deployment. This ensures that the network infrastructure supports the assigned addresses and subnets. \n7. **Consider future expansion:** Leave enough space for future growth in each department, preventing future address exhaustion and reducing reconfiguration work.\n8. **Implement robust monitoring and management tools:** Use network management tools to track IP address usage, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and ensure efficient resource utilization.",

It was simple to understand but highly inefficient, leading to massive IP address wastage. Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a more flexible and efficient system that uses variable-length subnet masks to allocate IP address space more precisely, reducing waste and allowing for more granular control of network segmentation.  CIDR improves routing efficiency compared to Classful. \n\n**Advantages of CIDR:** More efficient IP address allocation, improved routing scalability, and more flexible network design.\n\n**Disadvantages of CIDR:** More complex to understand and manage than Classful addressing, requiring advanced knowledge of subnetting and mask calculations.
